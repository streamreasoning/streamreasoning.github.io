            <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<p>The goal of the tutorial is to outline how to develop and deploy a stream processing application in a web environment in a reproducible way. To this extent, we intend to (1) survey existing research outcomes from the Stream Reasoning /RDF Stream Processing that arise in querying and reasoning on a variety of highly dynamic data, (2) introduce stream reasoning techniques as powerful tools to use when addressing a data-centric problem characterised both by variety and velocity (such as those typically found on the modern Web), (3) present a relevant Web-centric use-case that requires to address simultaneously data velocity and variety, and (4) guide the participants through the development of a Web stream processing application.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>More and more streams of information are becoming available on the Web. A variety of sources give origin to data streams including social networks, mobile phones, smart homes, healthcare devices and other modern infrastructures. A significant portion of these data belongs to the Web-of-Services and to the Web-of-Things ecosystems where data is published and consumed using Web standards and technologies. From new opportunities arise new challenges. A common problem in the scenarios illustrated above is how to integrate such data and how to enable the creation of new knowledge. Reasoning techniques are a possible solution. However, while reasoners scale up in the classical, static domain of ontological knowledge, reasoning upon rapidly changing information has received attention only very recently. The combination of reasoning techniques with data streams gives rise to Stream Reasoning. i.e., reasoning on highly dynamic flows of information. This is a high impact research area that has already started to produce.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Goals</strong>: The contents of this tutorial can be relevant for ICWE attendees as it focuses on the engineering aspects of developing and deploying applications that use streaming data to create new knowledge. This tutorial aims at introducing different existing approaches for querying and reasoning over data streams and providing guidelines to develop and deploy Stream Reasoning applications. In particular, the tutorial offers to the audience: (i) an overview of the use cases and the scenarios where Stream Reasoning can be used (with the advantages it brings); (ii) an overview of the current state of the art in this emerging area, with techniques and tools developed by several research groups (including but not limited to presenters ones); (iii) a focus on a subset of the technologies to perform complex reasoning over dynamic data.</p>

<p><strong>Related Events</strong>: The tutorial follows from the Stream Reasoning for Linked Data (SR4LD) tutorial series, successfully held at ESWC 2011, SemTech 2011, ISWC 2013, ISWC 2014, ISWC 2015; the RDF Stream Processing (RSP) tutorial series at ESWC 2014 and ISWC 2016; the Stream Reasoning: Managing Velocity and Variety in Big Data tutorial at DEBS 2016; and the tutorial on How to Build a Stream Reasoning Application co-located with ISWC 20171 . Technologies are now mature and reliable enough to make a step further and build a tutorial with a stronger focus on hands-on sessions. Therefore, this tutorial not only will survey existing research outcomes and introduce existing tools, but it will also present a relevant Web-centric use-case and guide the participants through application development of a Web stream processing application.</p>

<p><strong>Audience</strong>: The event targets researchers and practitioners interested in approaching the topic of web stream processing (both querying and reasoning) and who want to understand the current state of the art as well as the future directions. For this reason, the expected background knowledge is on basic concepts of RDF and SPARQL. The technologies and topics on this tutorial are relevant for people from IoT and sensor communities, as well as social media, pervasive health, oil industry, etc., who produce massive amounts of streaming data.</p>
