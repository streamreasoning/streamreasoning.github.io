<p><img src="images/eswc_logo.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>The goal of the Stream Reasoning for Linked Data tutorial is twofold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>to introduce scalable reasoning and querying techniques to SW researchers as powerful tool to make use of linked data and large-scale ontologies, and</li>
  <li>to present interesting research problems for SW that arise in reasoning with highly dynamic data streams [1,7].</li>
</ol>

<p>The tutorial consists of five parts. It will begin with an introduction of linked data, as well as the Semantic Web standard ontology language OWL 2 and its related reasoning services. The introduction will include examples of how to make use of OWL 2 ontologies in linked data and how to use reasoning services to exploit linked data. It will then start with semantic processing of data streams explained using C-SPARQL, a continuous extension of SPARQL for querying RDF streams and RDF graphs. The third part of the tutorial will present stream reasoning techniques for RDFS and OWL2-RL. The fourth part will introduce approximate stream reasoning techniques for OWL2-DL. The last part of the tutorial is a hands-on session on some tools and systems related to the first four parts.</p>
