* * *

After the successful Stream Reasoning workshops in Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, Linköping, Milan, and Amsterdam in previous years, the next edition of the workshop will be held in Lyon, France, **on December 4-6 2023**.  
**

The workshop is **invitation-only** and **free-of-charge** focuses on strengthening our growing community by sharing different perspectives, challenges, and experiences obtained by working with expressive yet efficient decision-making over rapidly changing data.

For Stream Reasoning to grow as a research area, it is very valuable to bring together these different views and goals, to exchange ideas in a relaxed and collaborative atmosphere. Therefore, this year we welcome submissions describing ideas and visions related to data and event streams. We encourage **short position** and **short demo papers** not exceeding 4 pages as well as longer **vision papers** not exceeding 6 pages. All papers can use unlimited references. The content of the papers will be presented and discussed during the work. The plan is organising a join publication on the same line of the well-known databases reports (few examples below):

Submission Website is the following [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=srw23](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=srw23)
The recommended template is [LNCS](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)

All papers can use unlimited references. The content of the papers will be presented and discussed during the workshop (we plan to alternate keynotes, presentations, and working groups).
 
- [The Asilomar report on database research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/306101.306137)
- [The Beckman report on database research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/2845915)
- [The Seattle report on database research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3385658.3385668)

Moroever, the organisers will be working for organising a special issue for the recently born [Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge (TGDK)](https://tgdk.org/), to foster the development of the presented ideas.

<!-- Submissions should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer Science [guidelines for proceedings](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) (please use LaTeX2e or Word Proceedings Templates).
