* * *

After the successful Stream Reasoning workshops in Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, Linköping, Milan, and Amsterdam in previous years, the next edition of the workshop will be held in Lyon, France, **on December 4-6 2023**.  
**

The workshop is **invitation-only** and **free-of-charge** and focuses on strengthening our growing community by sharing different perspectives, challenges, and experiences obtained by working with expressive yet efficient decision-making over rapidly changing data.

For Stream Reasoning to grow as a research area, it is very valuable to bring together these different views and goals to exchange ideas in a relaxed and collaborative atmosphere. Therefore, this year, we welcome submissions describing ideas and visions related to data and event streams. We encourage **short position** and **short demo papers** not exceeding four pages and longer **vision papers** not exceeding six pages. All papers can use unlimited references. The content of the papers will be presented and discussed during the work. The plan is to organising a joint publication on the same line as the well-known database reports (a few examples below):

The submission Website is the following [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=srw23](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=srw23)
The recommended template is [LNCS](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)

All papers can use unlimited references. The content of the papers will be presented and discussed during the workshop (we plan to alternate keynotes, presentations, and working groups).
 
- [The Asilomar report on database research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/306101.306137)
- [The Beckman report on database research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/2845915)
- [The Seattle report on database research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3385658.3385668)

However, the organisers will be working on organising a special issue for the recently born [Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge (TGDK)](https://tgdk.org/), to foster the development of the presented ideas.

<!-- Submissions should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer Science [guidelines for proceedings](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) (please use LaTeX2e or Word Proceedings Templates). Papers should be submitted in PDF format, but other formats are welcome upon agreement (please get in touch with the chairs in case). All submissions will be electronically via the [EasyChair](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2021) Web submission system.

All papers accepted to the workshop will be published in informal proceedings and on the workshop website. -->
