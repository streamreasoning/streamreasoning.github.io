After the successful Stream Reasoning workshops in Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, Linköping, Milan, Amsterdam, Lyon and Kortrijk in previous years, the next edition of the workshop will be held in Université Gustave Eiffel, Marne la Vallée, France, **on November 17-18 2025**.  


The workshop is **invitation-only** and **free-of-charge** and focuses on strengthening our growing community by sharing different perspectives, challenges, and experiences obtained by working with expressive yet efficient decision-making over rapidly changing data.

For Stream Reasoning to grow as a research area, it is very valuable to bring together these different views and goals to exchange ideas in a relaxed and collaborative atmosphere.
