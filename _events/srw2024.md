* * *

After the successful Stream Reasoning workshops in Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, Linköping, Milan, Amsterdam and Lyon in previous years, the next edition of the workshop will be held in Kortrijk, Belgium, **on December 12-13 2024**.  


The workshop is **invitation-only** and **free-of-charge** and focuses on strengthening our growing community by sharing different perspectives, challenges, and experiences obtained by working with expressive yet efficient decision-making over rapidly changing data.

For Stream Reasoning to grow as a research area, it is very valuable to bring together these different views and goals to exchange ideas in a relaxed and collaborative atmosphere.
